 Fill in some empty grid with the known values

 Make an original copy of the array
 Start from top left grid (nx = 0, ny = 0), check if grid is empty
 if (grid is empty) {
   assign the empty grid with values (i)
   if (no numbers exists in same rows & same columns same as (i) & 3x3 square (i) is currently in)
     fill in the number
   if (numbers exists in same rows | same columns same as (i) | 3x3 square (i) is currently in)
     discard (i) and repick other values (i++)
 }
 else {
   while (nx < 9) {
     Proceed to next row grid(nx++, ny)
     if (nx equals 9) {
       reset nx = 1
       proceed to next column grid(nx,ny++)
       if (ny equals 9) {
         print solution
       }
     }
   }
 }
